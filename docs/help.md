# Getting help

If you need help, or just want to chat, you can reach us:

- on irc: `#docker-distribution` on freenode
- on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/dockerproject.org/forum/#!forum/distribution) (mail at <distribution@dockerproject.org>)

If you want to report a bug:

- be sure to first read about [how to contribute](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- you can then do so on the [GitHub project bugtracker](https://github.com/docker/distribution/issues)

You can also find out more about the Docker's project [Getting Help resources](https://docs.docker.com/project/get-help).
